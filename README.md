# What is this? 
Castle Run is an endless game where you assume the role of a knight that mistakes the hot dog for an artifact, when it is, in fact, a cursed hot dog. Upon grabbing the hot dog, the reaper became vexed, and started to chase you. He's lazy though because he unleashed his minions to slow you down. How long can you survive?
This was made for educational purposes. The idea was to teach simple procedural world generation, specifically something in the style of Subway Surfers(instead of a guard chasing you, the reaper himself is chasing you). I didn't make the art, I got it from some free assets website, but sadly, I don't know which website I used.
I released the source code later than expected, which sucks considering I only spent about a day on this project. I got more projects on the way, so I don't have much time to fix some of the issues, hence why there are barely any updates on the other games/projects.
